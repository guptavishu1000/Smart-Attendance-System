I am Vishesh Gupta, student at IIT(BHU),Varanasi. This project is made under the Microsoft Engage 2022 Program as Mentee.

It is a smart attendance taking system where attendance is taken by showing up the face only.It is Desktop based Application.
Initially user need to register themself which takes upto 20-30 images of user at the moment of registeration. After the registeration process is over now you can you your attendance of any subject by clicking on `Take attendence` tab of home page.User can give his/her attendance then attendance sheet would available at the end.

- First clone the repository
- create the folder 'TrainingImage' inside this cloned folder which will store images.
- For running the file first install requirements.txt
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- then you can run main.py
- `python main.py`
- if take `Submit Attendance` Button on` Take Attendance` does not responds then run `pip uninstall opencv-contrib-python` and then  `pip install opencv-contrib-python` 1-2 times.
